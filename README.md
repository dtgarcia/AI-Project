# AI Project

This is an AI project where I will develop a chatbot with increasing complexity. Eventually, I aim to make it more interactive like Jarvis from Iron Man.

## Features:
- Conversational AI
- Basic logic and natural language processing
- Eventually adding voice functionality

## Installation:
- Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
- Navigate to the project folder.
- Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS
Future Plans:
- Voice Interaction
- Integration with external API's for more advanced responses
